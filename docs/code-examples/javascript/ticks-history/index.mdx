import SandboxIframe from '@site/src/components/SandboxIframe';
import { sandboxes } from '@site/src/components/SandboxIframe/utility/sandboxes';

With ticks history you are able to get a collection of past tick times and prices.

<SandboxIframe sandbox={sandboxes.ticks_history} />

We subscribe to the ticks functionality from the Deriv API websocket to keep track of current and past ticks.

As an example you could create an interactive tick graph.
